# Job Application Form 
## Description
  Job application form developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Field validation is added on input change using JavaScript. PHP has been used as a back-end language to send an email on the form submission. Form submission has been handled using JavaScript Fetch. HTML pages are responsive. I have used JSON format to transfer data using ajax (fetch).
